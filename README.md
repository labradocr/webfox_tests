# webfox_tests - Description
* Technical test for QA Automation
* There are the folders inside the project. Once for question in the technical test.

### Setup
* **node.js**: 
		version
* **Java Development Kit**: 
		java version "1.8.0_151"
		Java(TM) SE Runtime Environment (build 1.8.0_151-b12)
		Java HotSpot(TM) 64-Bit Server VM (build 25.151-b12, mixed mode)
 **npm**: 
		version 6.4.1
* **protactor**: 
		version 5.4.2
* **webdriver-manager**: 
		sI/version - webdriver-manager 12.1.1so
 **git**: 
		version 2.19.1.windows.1

### Implementation
* The implementation has been done with Eclipse.
* Test_1 and Test_2 are implemented in javascript and Test_3 is implemented with Selenium Webdriver using Protractor and the page object pattern.
* Pages in Test_3 are divided in getters and actions.
* Test_1 and Test_2 are completed and implemented. But Test_3 is not finished since I got and error as you can see below and I could not test the test and finished it.
  ***Message:
    Failed: Error while waiting for Protractor to sync with the page: "both angularJS testability and angular testability are undefined.  This could be either because this is a non-angular page or because your test involves client-side navigation, which can interfere with Protractor's bootstrapping.  See http://git.io/v4gXM for details"
* PersonalDataPage is not committed although I tried to implement something, but it would not have worked.

### Durantion

#### Setup environment
* I spent aproximately 1h doing the setup and installing everything in my own machine and checking protractor framework since I never worked with.

#### Test implementation
* The first two test were easy. I had to seek how to write some commands in javascript but it was not complicated. The duration was around 30 min for both.
* Third one was more difficult for me, because I could not execute the test due to that error which I could not fix. The duration implementing the classes was 1.30h but it was trying a lot of things to run the code and I spent 1 h more.
